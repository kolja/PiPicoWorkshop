Objective:

Introduce the students to the world of Microcontrollers: The tiny (and inexpensive) computers that are running all kinds of every day devices -- from keyboards to washing machines -- in this day and age.
The Raspberry Pi Pico (for example) can be programmed in Python which makes it really accessible. Workshop participants will become inventors, attach all kinds of LEDs and sensors and run their creation stand-alone with a 3V Battery.

Outcome:

Depending on the participants creative drive, the outcome could be anything from an electronic dice or a traffic light controller all the way to an electronic quiz, reaction or memory game. In any case: It will be a physical device that can run independently.

Favourite Part:

Normally, when you write code, it stays in the computer -- at best, it will display something interesting on screen. In this workshop however, your code will allow you to interact with "the real world". To me, tinkering with electronics (wires, resistors, LEDs ...) and seeing it come to life would be the best part.

Equipment:

Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040) + USB cables, Breadboard, colorful LEDs, Resistors (ca. 220Ohm), Jumper cables, little switches, piezo buzzer, 3V Battery + case, wire, insulating tape, brass paper fasteners, cardboard. Also: Computer with Thonny IDE installed.

Prerequisites:

No previous knowledge is required. Minimum age of 12.
