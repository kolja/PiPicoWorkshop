These are my plans for a 3 to 4-day workshop for kids aged 12 to 16.

# day 1

- Introductions:
	- Who am I
	- When and how did I start programming? (...when I was your age 35 years ago, with my Kaypro IV...)
	- Who are you?
		- have you programmed before?
		- What programming languages have you heard of?
- The Microcontroller:
    - The Raspberry Pi Pico [[./img/pico-pinout.svg]]
    - The Arduino Nano [[./img/nano-pinout.png]]
	- stick it in the breadboard and connect it to the computer
	- install and open our IDE Thonny
- Our first Programming Task:
	- You want to build a swimming pool in Minecraft, but you don't know how many blocks of marble you'll need
	- (Micro)Python programming basics:
		- what are variables?
		- what are functions?
		- some info about nesting / indentation
		- how to use the REPL
- Our second programming task:
	- the Raspi has a builtin LED (what is an LED?)
		- What is a diode [[diode.png]]
		- What is a LED [[leuchtdiode.png]]
	- let's get it to blink

# day 2

- Let's get an external LED to blink
	- Electronic circuits, + and - , how the Breadboard is wired up
	- LED's need a limiting resistor. What gives?
	- How to calculate the Ohm value for the limiting resistor
	- determining the resistor by looking at the colourful stripes [[farbcodes.png]]
	- measuring the resistance with a multimeter
- Create traffic light
- Plan Labyrinth
    - Draw it on paper
    - cut it out and glue it to a cardboard. Add brass pins

# day 3

- until noon: soldering wires to the pins on the Labyrinth
- Afternoon:
    - connect the Labyrinth to the Raspi
    - experiment with Piezo buzzer

# day 4

- debugging
- finishing touches
- show and tell
